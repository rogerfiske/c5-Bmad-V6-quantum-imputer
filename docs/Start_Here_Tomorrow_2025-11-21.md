## Where We Left Off

### Completed Yesterday (2025-11-20)

✅ **Dr. Elara V. Mercer agent created**
- Type: Expert Agent (standalone with persistent memory)
- Location: `.bmad/custom/agents/theoretical-mathematician/`
- Status: YAML defined, sidecar workspace populated, ready for compilation

✅ **Agent Capabilities Defined**
- 10 analytical commands embedded
- A-B-C Mathematical Validation Framework implemented
- Sovereignty protocols and provenance tracking configured
- Dataset paths configured: `data/raw/c5_full_Matrix_binary.csv` & `c5_Matrix.csv`

✅ **Documentation Created**
- Agent YAML (482 lines)
- Sidecar workspace (memories.md, instructions.md, knowledge/README.md)
- Session summary and project memory established

### Status: READY FOR COMPILATION ⚡

---

## Today's Objectives (Priority Order)

### 🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

#### 1. Compile Dr. Mercer Agent
**Task:** Transform YAML source to executable XML-in-markdown format

**Steps:**
1. Run BMAD Method installer
2. Point to: `C:\Users\Minis\CascadeProjects\c5-Bmad-V6-quantum-imputer`
3. Select: "Compile Agents (Quick rebuild of all agent .md files)"
4. Verify compilation successful
5. Note the slash command created (likely `/theoretical-mathematician`)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Compiled agent at: `.bmad/custom/agents/theoretical-mathematician.md`
- Slash command available in IDE
- Sidecar files copied to final location

**Time Estimate:** 5-10 minutes

---

#### 2. First Activation Test
**Task:** Activate Dr. Mercer and verify all systems operational

**Steps:**
1. Call the compiled agent: `/theoretical-mathematician` (or generated command)
2. Verify greeting displays correctly
3. Type `*help` to see menu
4. Confirm all 10 commands are listed
5. Test one simple command (e.g., `*recall` to verify sidecar access)
6. Test `*sovereignty-check` to ensure protocols load correctly

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Agent activates without errors
- ✅ Greeting mentions Roger by name (from config)
- ✅ All 10 commands + help/exit visible in menu
- ✅ Sidecar files load correctly (check for confirmation in responses)
- ✅ Dr. Mercer exhibits correct communication style (evidence-based, methodical, efficient)

**Troubleshooting Plan:**
- If compilation fails → Check YAML syntax, ensure installer version compatible
- If sidecar files don't load → Verify {agent-folder} path resolution
- If commands missing → Check menu compilation in .md output

**Time Estimate:** 10-15 minutes

---

#### 3. Team Planning Session
**Task:** Design Dr. Mercer's analytical team for QS/QV System v2

**Roger's Intent (from yesterday):**
> "I will probably later (tomorrow) want to either add her to an existing Bmad team or create a team for her with Architect, Dev, and other agents you can recommend"

**Discussion Points:**

**A. Team Structure Options**

**Option 1: Create Custom QS/QV Module**
- Pros: Dedicated team, specialized workflows, clean separation
- Cons: More setup time, separate from other BMAD modules
- Best for: Long-term QS/QV project with multiple analytical methods

**Option 2: Integrate with Existing BMM Team**
- Pros: Immediate collaboration, established workflows, team infrastructure ready
- Cons: BMM focused on software development, may need customization
- Best for: Quick start, leveraging existing BMAD Method workflows

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Dr. Mercer as standalone sovereign
- Ad-hoc team collaboration via Party Mode
- Custom workflows created as needed
- Best for: Experimental phase, methodology testing

**B. Recommended Team Members**

**Core Team (Minimum):**
1. **Dr. Mercer** (Mathematical Sovereign) - Already created ✅
2. **Architect** (System Designer) - Technical architecture for implementations
3. **Dev** (Developer) - Code mathematical models and analysis tools
4. **Analyst** (Domain Expert) - Requirements, context, business logic

**Extended Team (Optional):**
5. **Data Scientist** - Statistical modeling, ML integration if needed
6. **Tech Writer** - Documentation of findings, theorem publishing
7. **UX Designer** - Visualization of mathematical patterns
8. **PM (Project Manager)** - Coordinate experiments and track methodologies

**C. Team Workflow Patterns**

**Typical Analysis Flow:**
```
1. Analyst defines hypothesis
2. Dr. Mercer validates mathematical structure (A-B-C framework)
3. Architect designs implementation approach
4. Dev builds analysis tools/models
5. Dr. Mercer validates results against theorems
6. Tech Writer documents findings
```

**Decision Required:** Which team structure does Roger prefer?

**Time Estimate:** 30-45 minutes (discussion + decision)

---

### 🎯 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES (If Time Permits)

#### 4. First Dataset Analysis (Mini Experiment)
**Task:** Run Dr. Mercer's first analytical command on QS/QV data

**Steps:**
1. Activate Dr. Mercer
2. Run command: `*analyze-dataset`
3. When prompted, select: `data/raw/c5_Matrix.csv` (smaller dataset first)
4. Observe Dr. Mercer's A-B-C validation process
5. Review results and provenance tracking
6. Check if theorem gets saved to memories.md

**Purpose:**
- Validate Dr. Mercer's analytical capabilities
- Test A-B-C framework in practice
- Verify provenance tracking works
- Establish baseline for dataset properties

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Layer A results: Combinatorial structure findings
- Layer B results: Analytic diagnostics
- Layer C results: GF(2) canonicalization
- Validation verdict: PASS/FAIL per layer
- Provenance hash generated

**Note:** First analysis may reveal need for additional mathematical libraries or tools. Document any gaps.

**Time Estimate:** 45-60 minutes

---

#### 5. Module/Team Infrastructure Setup
**Task:** Begin technical setup based on team planning decision

**If Custom Module Chosen:**
- Create module structure: `.bmad/qsqv/`
- Define module agents folder
- Plan workflow structure
- Design agent collaboration patterns

**If BMM Integration Chosen:**
- Review BMM workflows
- Identify integration points
- Plan Dr. Mercer → BMM agent handoffs
- Customize BMM workflows for mathematical analysis

**If Hybrid Chosen:**
- Document collaboration protocols
- Set up Party Mode configurations
- Define when to invoke which agents

**Time Estimate:** 30-60 minutes

## Key Information Quick Reference

### Project Datasets

**Location:** `C:\Users\Minis\CascadeProjects\c5-Bmad-V6-quantum-imputer\data\raw\`

**Files:**
- `c5_full_Matrix_binary.csv` - Full binary-encoded dataset
- `c5_Matrix.csv` - Primary matrix dataset

**Properties:**
- Binary encoding (GF(2) compatible)
- Sparse additive object structure
- Event columns with hole patterns

### Dr. Mercer's Commands (Reference)

1. `*analyze-dataset` - Full A-B-C analysis
2. `*validate-hypothesis` - Test mathematical claims
3. `*detect-structure` - Find patterns in sequences
4. `*layer-a` - Additive Combinatorics only
5. `*layer-b` - Analytic diagnostics only
6. `*layer-c` - Finite-field canonicalization only
7. `*save-theorem` - Store validated results
8. `*provenance` - Generate proof artifacts
9. `*sovereignty-check` - Anti-infiltration audit
10. `*recall` - Access past theorems

### A-B-C Framework Reminder

**Layer A (Additive Structure):**
- Checks: Stable recurrence, hole configuration, sumset compression
- Verdict: If fails → discard immediately

**Layer B (Analytic Diagnostics):**
- Checks: Fourier spikes, exponential sum anomalies, correlation decay
- Verdict: If uniform → classify as noise

**Layer C (Finite-Field Canonicalization):**
- Checks: GF(2) stability, invariant rank, canonical signature
- Verdict: Only when ALL three pass → accept insight

4. **Documentation Strategy:** How to track multiple experimental methodologies?
5. **Analysis Priority:** Which dataset first? What hypothesis to test?

### Technical Questions

1. Does Dr. Mercer need any additional mathematical libraries?
2. Should analysis results be stored in specific format?
