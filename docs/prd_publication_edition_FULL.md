# Sovereign QS/QV System v2  
## Product Requirements Document (PRD) — Publication Edition (Full Expansion)

# 1. Purpose & Context
The Sovereign QS/QV System v2 exists to identify, formalize, and predict structural patterns within an extremely sparse binary dataset representing Quantum States (QS1–QS5) and their derived Quantum Values (QV). The system’s core goal is to determine the **20 least-likely QVs** that will appear in the next event, using deterministic, mathematically justified, and canonical methods.

This PRD outlines the full scientific, mathematical, engineering, and governance requirements of the system.

# 2. Product Vision
The product serves as a **mathematically sovereign analysis engine** that:
- Converts raw QS/QV data into canonical forms  
- Extracts deep structure through additive combinatorics  
- Validates structure through analytic number theory  
- Stabilizes structure through finite-field algebra  
- Predicts exclusions through deterministic logic  
- Maintains tamperproof provenance through a cryptographic ledger  
- Operates under Dr. Mercer’s mathematical governance protocols
