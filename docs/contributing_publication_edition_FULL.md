# Sovereign QS/QV System v2  
## Contributing Guidelines — Publication Edition (Full Expansion)

---

# 1. Introduction

These **Contributing Guidelines** establish the full standards, protocols, mathematical requirements, engineering expectations, sovereignty protections, and provenance obligations for all collaborators participating in the **Sovereign QS/QV System v2**.  
All contributions—mathematical, engineering, or documentation—must comply with the system’s canonical, deterministic, and sovereignty-enforced architecture governed by **Dr. Elara V. Mercer**.

This document defines:

- Contributor roles  
- Mathematical correctness requirements  
- Engineering and coding standards  
- Canonicalization rules  
- A–B–C validation obligations  
- Ledger and provenance duties  
- Anti-infiltration procedures  
- Review workflows  
- Forbidden practices  

This is a **publication-grade** contributing standard for long-term governance of the system.
