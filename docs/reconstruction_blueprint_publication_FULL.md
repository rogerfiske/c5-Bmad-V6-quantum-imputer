# Sovereign QS/QV System v2  
## Reconstruction Blueprint — Publication Edition (Full Expansion)

# 1. Introduction
The Reconstruction Blueprint defines the complete methodology for transforming the existing QS/QV analytical system—from its inherited Brownfield state—into the fully sovereign, mathematically rigorous, and canonically stable **Sovereign QS/QV System v2** governed by Dr. Elara V. Mercer.

This publication-grade blueprint details:
- Brownfield assessment  
- Failure-mode analysis  
- Required structural replacements  
- Clean-room mathematical reconstruction  
- Canonical architecture redevelopment  
- Implementation pathways  
- Governance, provenance, and sovereignty enforcement

# 2. Brownfield Autopsy: System-Level Diagnostic

## 2.1 Historical Constraints
The inherited system exhibits:
- Heavy reliance on implicit heuristics  
- Mixed stochastic & deterministic logic  
- Unclear mathematical boundaries  
- No canonical GF(2) foundation  
- No provenance or cryptographic sealing  
- Missing analytic validation layers  
- No structural decomposition of patterns  
- No additive-combinatorial signatures  
- No lattice organization of discovered patterns

## 2.2 Identified Failure Modes

### 2.2.1 Randomness Misclassification
Sparse binary signals incorrectly analyzed as stochastic noise.

### 2.2.2 Non-Deterministic Behavior
Modules produce inconsistent outputs across runs and environments.

### 2.2.3 Lack of Canonical Forms
Event vectors not mapped into GF(2) canonical equivalence classes.

### 2.2.4 Unsupported Predictions
Predictions generated without mathematically justified exclusion principles.

### 2.2.5 No Ledger or Provenance
System has no verifiable history or chain-of-reasoning audit trail.

### 2.2.6 Vulnerability to Infiltration
External reasoning sources could contaminate results unnoticed.

5. **Ledger-backed provenance**  
6. **Infiltration-resistant architecture**
