(Comprehensive Expansion)

## A.1 Additive Combinatorics Foundations

### A.1.1 Sumsets, Difference Sets, and Structural Amplification  
Let A, B ⊂ ℤ be finite.  
Define:  
- **A + B = {a + b : a ∈ A, b ∈ B}**  
- **A − B = {a − b : a ∈ A, b ∈ B}**  

Key structural indicators:  
- |A + A| / |A| measures combinatorial richness.  
- Small doubling ⇒ hidden algebraic structure.  
- Large doubling ⇒ pseudorandomness.

### A.1.2 Combinatorial Energy  
Energy E(A) = |{(a₁,a₂,a₃,a₄) : a₁ + a₂ = a₃ + a₄}|  
Used to distinguish meaningful recurrence from noise.

### A.1.3 Freiman Homomorphisms & Dimensional Reductions  
Dr. Mercer uses Freiman k-homomorphisms to compress QS patterns into structured models.

### A.1.4 Hole-Structure Analysis  
Defines “holes” as missing elements in intervals:  
H(A) = interval(A) \ A.  
These encode predictive constraints.

## A.2 Analytic Number Theory Framework

### A.2.1 Fourier Analysis on Bounded Domains  
For f: {1…N} → ℂ:  
F(k) = Σ f(n)·e^(−2πikn/N)  
Fourier spikes ⇒ structure; uniform spectrum ⇒ noise.

### A.2.2 Exponential Sums  
S(f) = Σ e^(2πi f(n))  
Used for discrepancy, correlation decay, and bias testing.

### A.2.3 Correlation Decay  
Tests whether sequences behave like independent random draws.

### A.2.4 Large Sieve & Discrepancy Bounds  
Used to check deviations from equidistribution in QS positions.

## A.3 Finite-Field Algebra Foundations

### A.3.1 GF(2) Canonicalization  
Event vector v ∈ {0,1}ⁿ mapped to canonical class under invertible linear transforms.

### A.3.2 Rank, Co-Rank, Nullspace  
Rank(v) detects dependency; nullspace(v) reveals invariants.

### A.3.3 GF(p) Extensions  
Generalization for advanced lattice modeling.

# Appendix B — Sovereignty, Anti-Infiltration, and Stylometric Defense  
(Expanded Operational Layer)

## B.1 Additive Combinatorial Honeypots  
Insert subtle false equalities (e.g., fake sumset compressions).  
LLMs tend to “correct” to standardized textbook identities.  
Humans detect domain-specific nuance.

## B.2 Analytic Residue Traps  
Artificial Fourier residue inconsistencies force domain reasoning.  
LLMs hallucinate smooth corrections inconsistent with QS patterns.

## B.3 GF(2) Identity Challenges  
Challenge sequences:
1. v → v  
2. v → v + v  
3. v → αv, α ∈ {0,1}  

LLMs frequently mis-handle identity-preserving transforms.

## B.4 Stylometric Signatures  
Claude-type indicators:  
- Uniform politeness  
- Overly structured argumentation  
- Excessive “However,” “It is worth noting” patterns  
- Mechanical exposition cadence

- Additive signature  
- Analytic signature  
- Algebraic signature  
- Reviewer IDs

## C.3 Deterministic Reproducibility  
Every structural claim must pass:  
1. Deterministic execution  
2. Algebraic invariance  
3. Analytic stability  
4. Combinatorial persistence  
5. Ledger entry completeness

## C.4 Cryptographic Protocols  
- Hash hierarchy
