# BMAD Builder Housekeeping Handoff
## Session 2025-11-23 - Validation Testing Complete

---

## VALIDATION TESTS COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Agent Activation Tests ✅
**Objective:** Verify all three research agents activate correctly

1. **Dr. Rowan Ó Brien (ML Theorist)** - `/bmad:custom:agents:ml-theorist`
   - Status: OPERATIONAL
   - Config loaded: ✅
   - Sidecar files loaded (3): ✅
   - Commands displayed (11): ✅
   - Character maintained: ✅
   - Clean exit: ✅

2. **Dr. Kai Nakamura (Implementation Specialist)** - `/bmad:custom:agents:research-dev`
   - Status: OPERATIONAL
   - Config loaded: ✅
   - Sidecar files loaded (3): ✅
   - Commands displayed (11): ✅
   - Character maintained: ✅
   - Clean exit: ✅

3. **Dr. Elara V. Mercer (Mathematical Sovereign)** - `/bmad:custom:agents:theoretical-mathematician`
   - Status: OPERATIONAL
   - Previously tested 2025-11-21: ✅
   - Re-activated today for dataset analysis: ✅

**Verdict:** All three agents fully operational. Team ready for research.

---

### Phase 2: Dataset Analysis Test ✅
**Objective:** Validate Dr. Mercer's `*analyze-dataset` command on real QS/QV data

**Dataset:** `C:\Users\Minis\CascadeProjects\c5-Bmad-V6-quantum-imputer\data\raw\c5_Matrix.csv`
- Events: 11,623
- QV Columns: 39
- Format: Binary sparse matrix (GF(2) compatible)

**Analysis Performed:**
- Layer A (Additive Combinatorics): PARTIAL PASS
- Layer B (Analytic Number Theory): PARTIAL PASS
- Layer C (Finite-Field Algebra): PASS
- Provenance hash generated: `bd2197d8...` (SHA-512)
- Results saved to memories.md

**Verdict:** Analysis command fully functional. First pattern discovery logged (Analysis PD-001).

## FILES CREATED/MODIFIED TODAY

### PERMANENT FILES (KEEP - Research Artifacts)

1. **`.bmad/custom/agents/theoretical-mathematician/theoretical-mathematician-sidecar/memories.md`**
   - Modified: Added Analysis PD-001 (first dataset analysis results)
   - Type: Research archive
   - Status: PERMANENT - contains validated research findings
   - Action: **KEEP**

### TEMPORARY FILES (NONE IDENTIFIED)

**No temporary test files were created during validation.**

All validation tests were performed using:
- Existing agent activation sequences (no test scaffolding created)
- Real dataset analysis (legitimate research, not mock data)
- Standard sidecar memory persistence (production workflow)

---

## HOUSEKEEPING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Files to Review for Potential Cleanup

**None identified from today's validation session.**

### Potential Cleanup from Previous Sessions (Optional Review)

Check for:
1. **Old session logs** in sidecar `sessions/` directories (if any exist)
2. **Duplicate persona files** from BMAD installer:
   - `.claude/commands/bmad/custom/agents/dr_elara_mercer_Theoretical_Mathematician_persona.md` (simple persona wrapper - redundant with full expert agent)
   - `.claude/commands/bmad/custom/agents/dr_kai_nakamura_Research_Implementation_Specialist_persona.md` (simple persona wrapper - redundant)
   - `.claude/commands/bmad/custom/agents/dr_rowan_obrien_ML_engineer_persona.md` (simple persona wrapper - redundant)

   **Note:** These were auto-generated by BMAD installer. The actual expert agents are:
   - `theoretical-mathematician.md`
   - `ml-theorist.md`
   - `research-dev.md`

   The persona wrappers are redundant but harmless. Delete if desired for cleanliness.

3. **Start_Here_Tomorrow guides** older than 1 week (archival decision by Roger)
4. **Session_Summary files** older than 1 month (archival decision by Roger)

## VALIDATION SUMMARY

### What Was Tested
- ✅ All 3 research agents activate correctly
- ✅ All sidecar workspaces load properly
- ✅ Dr. Mercer's dataset analysis command functional
- ✅ A-B-C validation framework operational
- ✅ Provenance tracking works (SHA-512 hashing)
- ✅ Memory persistence works (memories.md updated correctly)

### What Was NOT Tested
- ⏳ Team collaboration (Party Mode) - pending
- ⏳ Dr. Ó Brien's architecture design commands - pending
- ⏳ Dr. Nakamura's implementation commands - pending
- ⏳ Multi-agent handoffs (Mercer → Ó Brien → Nakamura workflow) - pending

### Outstanding TODO Items
1. ⏳ Test team collaboration (Party Mode)
2. ⏳ Update Project_Memory.md with today's accomplishments
3. ⏳ Create Start_Here_Tomorrow_2025-11-24.md

---

## BUILDER ACTION ITEMS

### Review This Handoff
1. Read validation summary above
2. Confirm no temporary test files need deletion
3. Decide on optional cleanup (redundant persona wrappers)

### Housekeeping Tasks
1. **KEEP** all research artifacts (memories.md with Analysis PD-001)
2. **OPTIONAL:** Delete redundant persona wrapper agents if desired
3. **OPTIONAL:** Archive old documentation per Roger's preferences

### Resume Session
1. Mark "Run first dataset analysis with Dr. Mercer" as COMPLETED in todo list
2. Proceed with remaining todos:
   - Test team collaboration (Party Mode)
   - Update Project_Memory.md
   - Create Start_Here_Tomorrow guide
